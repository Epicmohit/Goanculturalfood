      <h2>Chicken Cafreal</h2>
      <p>
        Chicken Cafreal is a flavorful and spicy Goan dish with strong Portuguese and African influences, introduced to Goa by Portuguese colonists. This dish is known for its deep green color, which comes from a fresh marinade made of coriander leaves, green chilies, garlic, ginger, pepper, and aromatic spices. The chicken is marinated in this vibrant paste for several hours to absorb the rich flavors, then typically shallow-fried or grilled until tender and juicy. Often served with potato wedges, lemon slices, or simple salads, Chicken Cafreal is a favorite in Goan households and restaurants alike. Its tangy, spicy, and herbaceous taste makes it a standout dish in Goan cuisine.
